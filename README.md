#### A simple demo shows the usage of server-client-based Java RMI.

---



# Usage:

1. Run RMIserver.java in IntelliJ.

2. Run RMIClient.javain in IntelliJ.

   The client code will lookup a server by a identical server URL and then obtain an instance of object instantiated in server JVM.
   
   So the client code can call any methods of this instance of object.
